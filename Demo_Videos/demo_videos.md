*NOTE*: Although the CI/CD pipeline for gitlab is also built. But I do not have the access to gitlab currently as subscription is finished because I graduated from university. I was using university account to use gitlab. After graduation the access was denied. But if you have the subscription, you can try running the CICD on Gitlab as well.
