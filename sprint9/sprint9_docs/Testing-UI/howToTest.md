- Download the .side file found on this directory.
- Open your terminal
- Redirect to the directory that contains the downloaded file.
- Ensure you have the Selenium IDE chrome extension installed.
- Ensure you install its Runner: 
    - brew install node
    - npm install -g selenium-side-runner
- Back to your terminal, run "selenium-side-runner Sprint7.side"
- "All_course_Tree.side" will take around 2-3 min Safari to work and 5 min to work on Chrome as the script has to go through all the data ses and make connections and generate trees and graphs.
The test cases will run.
