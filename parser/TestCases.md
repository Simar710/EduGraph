The file contains different test cases which test various scenarios and functionalities that the code should handle correctly:

# Test Cases:

**Test Case 1: Valid Input File**

- Description: Test using a valid input file, which contains course information.
- Input: A valid input file with course information.
- Expected Result: The program should accurately read the input file and produce a CSV file with the data.

**Test Case 2: Missing Input File**

- Description: Test the code without input file.
- Input: A path to an invalid or missing input file.
- Expected Result: The code must gracefully handle the issue and display the proper error message.

**Test Case 3: Invalid Input File Format**

- Description: Test the code with an unsupported input file format. 
- Input: An unsupported input file format. For example: Non-text file.
- Expected Result: If the file format is not supported, the function should handle the problem and provide an appropriate error message.

**Test Case 4: Empty Input File**

- Description: Test the code with an empty input file.
- Input: An empty input file.
- Expected Result: The code mustÂ handle empty files and output a notice stating that there are no courses to parse.

**Test Case 5: Valid Course Data**

- Description: Test the code with valid course data in the input file.
- Input: A valid input file containing one or more courses.
- Expected Result: The program should properly interpret the course data, and output the results to the CSV file.

**Test Case 6: Course Data with Prerequisites**

- Description: Test course data that contains prerequisites.
- Input: Input file with courses containing prerequisites.
- Expected Result: The prerequisites should be accurately parsed by the code and stored in the Course objects.

**Test Case 7: Course Data without Prerequisites**

- Description: Test the code with course data that does not have any prerequisites.
- Input: Input file with courses that do not have prerequisites.
- Expected Result: Courses without prerequisites should be properly parsed and stored by the code.

**Test Case 8: Valid Output CSV File**
- Description: Test that the code generates a valid CSV output file.
- Input: Valid input file with course data.
- Expected Result: The produced CSV file must be properly structured and include the course data that has been processed.

**Test Case 9: Performance Testing**

- Description: With a large input file including a lot of courses, evaluate the code's performance.
- Input: A large input file with a substantial amount of course data.
- Expected Result: The code should output the CSV file without experiencing any performance concerns when handling the big input.

**Test Case 10: Special Characters in Course Names**

- Description: Include courses with special characters in their names or descriptions 
- Input: "Introduction to C++" 
- Expected Result: Verify that the program can handle and display such course names correctly in the output spreadsheet

**Test Case 11: Duplicate Course Entries**
- Description: Test the program's ability to handle duplicate course entries. 
- Input: CIS*2500 is duplicated and has two rows in the textfile
- Expected Result: Ensure that if there are duplicate courses in the input data, they are appropriately handled and not duplicated in the output Excel spreadsheet.

**Test Case 12: Multiple Prerequisites separated by AND**
- Description: Test that prerequisites that are separated by AND are parsed correctly
- Input: "Prerequisite(s): ANSC*3080, ANSC*3090"
- Expected Result: "ANSC*3080, ANSC*3090"

**Test Case 13: Multiple Prerequisites separated by OR**
- Description: Test that prerequisites that are separated by OR are parsed correctly
- Input: "Prerequisite(s): ACCT*1220 or ACCT*2220"
- Expected Result: "ACCT*1220 | ACCT*2220"

**Test Case 14: Multiple Prerequisites separated by AND/OR**
- Description: Test that prerequisites that are separated by AND as well as OR are parsed correctly
- Input: "Prerequisite(s): BIOC*2580, (CHEM*2400 or CHEM*2480)"
- Expected Result: "BIOC*2580, CHEM*2400 | CHEM*2480"

**Test Case 15: Multiple Prerequisites separated by AND/OR and meets credit limit**
- Description: Test that prerequisites that are separated by AND and OR as well as a credit limit are parsed correctly
- Input: "Prerequisite(s): 15.00 credits including ANTH*3690, (SOAN*3070 or SOAN*3120)"
- Expected Result: "15.00 credits, ANTH*3690, SOAN*3070 | SOAN*3120"

**Test Case 16: Restriction Count of 1**
- Description: Test that courses with 1 course restriction are correctly parsed
- Input: "Restriction(s): ACCT*2220. This is a Priority Access Course. Enrolment may be restricted to particular programs or specializations. See department for more information."
- Expected Result: "{ACCT*2220}"

**Test Case 17: Multiple Restrictions**
- Description: Test that courses with multiple course restriction are correctly parsed
- Input: "Restriction(s): BIOL*1050, BIOL*1070, BIOL*1080, BIOL*1090"
- Expected Result: "{BIOL*1050,BIOL*1070,BIOL*1080,BIOL*1090}"

**Test Case 18: Entering Courses in Excel**
- Description: Entering a course with the "*" symbol, inconsistent capitalization, should all yield the same results
- Input: cIS1300, ACCT1220, cis*4720 (one per cell)
- Expected Result: List of eligible courses (one per cell)
