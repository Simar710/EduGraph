-   Sara will focus on revamping the UI by utilizing Bootstrap and make the site more responsive and accessible
    -   Will work on automated testing for the website code using Selenium
-   Simardeep will refactor the codebase ensuring there are no long functions, unused variables and logic, and overall cleaning up the code
    -   Will work with Maneesh to clean up the website URL's and API to not use query strings
-   Fee Kim will work closely with Emily to switch over the API to our own one instead of the other groups
    -   Will assist Emily in the logic to improve our course recommendation algorithm
