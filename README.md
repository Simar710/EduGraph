## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Description
F23 CIS*3760 Sprint 1:
There are two steps (with a bonus step invovled) regarding the purpose behind this sprint 1 repo:

Step 1:
- Parse the course information using Python 3 and save it to an Excel spreadsheet.

Step 2:
- Create a Python 3 command-line program, compatible with Linux, OSX, and Windows, that loads the course data from the file generated in Step 1, stores it in memory, and allows users to perform searches on it without modifying the course data. The end goal is to provide a search CLI that enables users to search the file multiple times before exiting. 

Furthermore, this repo also contains research regarding VBA and any other documentation needed to successfully complete this sprint; including a burndown chart.
