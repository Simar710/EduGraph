### Have a look at other branches as well for progressive development of the project. The branches are named as sprint1, sprint2,... There were 9 sprints. All the sprints have their particular tasks and description. The main branch have changes from sprint 9 only.
### Project: EduGraph

   ### Summary:
   -   Created a web application with team.
   -   Parsed the data into csv using python, developed a Python-based CLI and Excel UI using VBA.
   -   Stored the data in a MySQL database and architect the PHP REST APIs, featuring PHP web applications for course recommendations, prerequisite graphs, hosted using Nginx and a CI/CD pipeline for enhanced functionality and reliability.


### 1. **Course Data Management:**
   - Developed a Python-based CLI for parsing and searching course information, generating Excel outputs, and documenting sprint progress (Sprint 1 & 2).
   - Designed an Excel UI with VBA scripts to assess student eligibility for courses based on completed coursework (Sprint 2).

### 2. **Web and Database Integration:**
   - Created a web interface for downloading course data and viewing team member pages; enhanced with a MySQL database and PHP REST API for course data manipulation (Sprint 3 & 4).
   - Improved API endpoints, refactored code, and enhanced UI responsiveness and accessibility using Bootstrap; implemented automated testing (Sprint 5 & 7).

### 3. **Advanced Features and Optimization:**
   - Developed a web application for course recommendations based on past coursework, utilizing external APIs (Sprint 6).
   - Implemented course prerequisite graphs, dark mode, and optimized website performance; established a CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration and testing (Sprint 8 & 9).
