## Current Sprint

Sprint 6

## Description

**Project Overview**

In Sprint 6 for F23 CIS*3760, our team will be developing a web application on our VM (Virtual Machine). This web application will allow students to enter information about their past courses, and our application will provide them with recommendations about which courses they can take in the future. Our primary goal is to empower students to make informed decisions regarding their academic paths based on their prior coursework.


**API Usage**

We are required to use the API of the team assigned to us, as listed on the second page of the documentation.
We should not update or modify our assigned API unless requested by the team that owns it.
