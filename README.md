## Current Sprint

Sprint 8

## Description

**Project Overview**

In Sprint 8 for F23 CIS\*3760, our team will be generating graph for course pre-requisites as a tree diagram on our website by implementing the following:

-   Choose the appropriate JavaScript library
-   Identify Root Node and Build Tree Structure
-   Responsive & Accessible UI
-   Implement Dark Mode
-   **NOTE**
    -   Generating the tree for all courses will take a significant amount of time due to the number of courses offered and connections between them
    -   We have done as much optimization as we could and on Safari/Firefox, the time will take around 1 minute
    -   On Chrome, however, due to not handling concurrent API calls the same, will take longer about 2-3 minutes

## Team Approach

-   Simar will create tasks, lead group meetings, and ensure everyone is okay with what tasks they are working on this sprint
    -   Will develop user stories/test cases and Implement dark mode.
-   Sara, Fee, Maneesh and Emily will work in team programming format and work together on following tasks.
    -   Identify Nodes and Build Tree structure using the chosen javascript library.
    -   Build UI Design and Tree Design
