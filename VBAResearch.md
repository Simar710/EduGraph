# Purpose
The purpose of this file is to share any research notes that we took while learning more about VBA

# Sara Adi's Notes:
- A Microsoft Excel VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) application is a set of customized, automated functions and commands created to enhance Excel's capabilities. 
- Automation: Excel VBA automates tasks in Excel by writing custom code (macros) that can perform actions like calculations, data manipulation, and formatting automatically.
- Customization: It allows users to create personalized tools and features tailored to specific needs, such as automating repetitive tasks, generating reports, or building interactive forms within Excel.
- Coding: Users write VBA code using the VBA editor integrated into Excel. This code consists of instructions in a programming language (Visual Basic) that tells Excel what to do.
- Event-Driven: VBA applications can be triggered by specific events, like clicking a button or opening a workbook, making them respond to user actions or changes in the data.
- Macros: VBA macros are scripts that bundle a series of actions into a single command. Users can record macros by performing tasks manually, and Excel will generate the VBA code automatically.

Notes:
- Developer tab to utilize VBA is usually disabled. Turn on through "Customize Ribbon" on the settings of excel
- Alt + F11 shortcut to open the VB tab
